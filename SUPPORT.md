### Tips for filing issues

If you run into any issues while working with the F5 Journeys App, before you file a bug-report go through this these steps first, 
this is to ensure that F5 triages the problems as efficiently as possible:

* Check if the issue has been discussed and is closed/resolved

When you file an issue with the F5 Journeys App, an Issue template appears.

F5 will try to reproduce your environment, so in the template, please provide as much information as possible.

#### Some things F5 wants to know are:

* F5OS Platform version and hardware hosting destination BIG-IP (tenant)
* Destination and Source BIG-IP TMOS version
* F5 Journeys App Version
* If this is a feature request description of what the feature would achieve and current alternatives you are using

#### Some of the things that F5 does not want, and will never ask for are:

* passwords
* license keys
* public disclosure of your company or company contact info


**Do not comment on closed issues**

##### When you comment on closed issues:

* F5 cannot reproduce the issue properly in the code base.
* F5 does not usually receive the notification for the comment.

##### Why is commenting on closed issues a problem for the code base?

If you do not create a **new** issue:

* F5 might accidentally change code that was already working.
* It is harder to track which issue any new code relates to.
* It is harder to repro other issues over time.
* Because of this, F5 asks that you not comment on closed issues.
